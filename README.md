Hangman Game with Admin Portal
This Python project is a console-based Hangman game that includes a unique feature: an admin portal. The game challenges players to guess a randomly selected word from a predefined list within a limited number of attempts and a set time frame. The admin portal allows administrators to manage the word list by adding or removing words, making the game customizable and dynamic.
